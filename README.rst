FLOZz Daily Mix
===============

|GitHub| |License| |Discord| |Github Actions| |Black|

FLOZz Daily Mix generates playlists similar to Spotify's Daily Mix from a Subsonic API.

This is currently a **work in progress** and it has only been tested against ownCloud¬†/ Nextcloud Music servers. Please note that only the legacy plain text password authentication is currently supported; that's why it will probably not work with most Subsonic servers.

This generator does not make completely random playlists but tries to build interesting ones. It adds "interesting" tracks regularly in the playlist (more at the beginning of the list and a more spaced then). It also tries to put new/fresh tracks in at strategic places.

Here is an example of a generated playlist:

.. figure:: ./example-playlist.png
   :target: ./example-playlist.png
   :alt: Screenshot: Generated playlist

* **Yellow:** "interesting" tracks (criteria: high rating, liked,...)
* **Green:** "fresh" tracks (criteria: newly added, recently released, low play count,...)
* **Blue:** "regular" tracks (random tracks with note weighting)


Requirements
------------

This software only requires **Python >= 3.8**. There is no extra dependency.


Install
-------

Linux: from PyPI with venv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install FLOZz Daily Mix on Linux, the simplest way is to use the package from PyPI.

First be sure to have Python 3 installed with the venv module. On Debian¬†/ Ubuntu, you can achieve this with the following command::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv

Then we can create the virtualenv to install the app::

    python3 -m venv ./daily-mix.venv

And finally we can install FLOZz Daily Mix in the venv::

    ./daily-mix.venv/bin/pip install flozz-daily-mix

To run the software, just call its executable with a command like this::

    ./daily-mix.venv/bin/flozz-daily-mix --help


Configuration files
-------------------

To generate playlists with FLOZz Daily Mix, you should at least create one file with some information about the playlists. This file can also contain the Subsonic API settings and credential, but you will also be able to pass them later on the CLI.

Here is a commented example of a valid ``flozz-daily-mix.conf`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [subsonic]
    ; URL of the Subsonic API.
    ; Can also be provieded using the --subsonic-api-url CLI option.
    api_url = https://nextcloud.example.org/apps/music/subsonic
    ; Name of the Subsonic API user.
    ; Can also be provieded using the --subsonic-api-username CLI option.
    api_username = foobar
    ; Password of the Subsonic API user.
    ; Can also be provieded using the --subsonic-api-password CLI option.
    api_password = s3cr3tp4ssw0rd
    ; Use the Subsonic legacy (plaintext password) authentication method
    ; (default: false). By default this is turned off, but the legacy
    ; authentication is currently the only one supported so you must set it to
    ; "true".
    api_legacy_authentication = true

    ; [playlist:<PLAYLIST_UNIQUE_ID>]
    [playlist:mix1]
    ; Name of the playlist. Will be displayed by music clients (default: "Unnamed Mix")
    name = FLOZz Mix 1
    ; An optional description for the playlist (default: "FLOZz Daily Mix")
    description = FLOzz Daily Mix
    ; Maximum number of tracks in the playlist (default: 60).
    max_tracks = 60
    ; Minimal duration of tracks included in the playlist in seconds (default: 60)
    min_track_duration = 60
    ; Maximal duration of tracks included in the playlist in seconds (default: 600)
    max_track_duration = 600

    ; An other playlist
    [playlist:mix2]
    name = FLOZz Mix 2
    description = FLOzz Daily Mix
    max_tracks = 60
    min_track_duration = 60
    max_track_duration = 600


Usage
-----

Once you have installed FLOZz Daily Mix and created a configuration file, you can start generating playlists.

**NOTE:** in this section I will use commands like ``flozz-daily-mix --help`` for readability, but if you installed FLOZz Daily Mix in a virtualenv as explained above, the command you should use will be something like ``/path/to/your/daily-mix.venv/bin/flozz-daily-mix --help``.

If your API credentials are configured in the file, you can generate your playlists with the following command::

    flozz-daily-mix generate flozz-daily-mix.conf

If you do not write API configuration in the file, then the command will be a bit longer::

    flozz-daily-mix \
        --subsonic-api-url=https://nextcloud.example.org/apps/music/subsonic \
        --subsonic-api-username=foobar \
        --subsonic-api-password=s3cr3tp4ssw0rd \
        --subsonic-api-legacy-authentication \
        generate flozz-daily-mix.conf

**NOTE:** You can pass more than one configuration file, if you prefer writing one file by playlist.

You can also just generate and display playlists without writing them to the cloud with the following command::

    flozz-daily-mix generate --dry-run --print-playlist flozz-daily-mix.conf

To get all available options, you can use the following commands::

    flozz-daily-mix --help
    flozz-daily-mix generate --help
    flozz-daily-mix dumpdata --help  # debug feature

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

If you have any question, you can:

* `Open an issue <https://github.com/flozz/daily-mix/issues>`_ on GitHub
* `Ask on Discord <https://discord.gg/P77sWhuSs4>`_ (I am not always available to chat, but I try to answer to everyone)


Bugs
~~~~

Please `open an issue <https://github.com/flozz/daily-mix/issues>`_ on GitHub with as much information as possible if you found a bug:

* Your operating system¬†/ Linux distribution (and its version)
* How you installed the software
* All the logs and message outputted by the software
* etc.


Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please consider `filing a bug <https://github.com/flozz/daily-mix/issues>`_ before starting to work on a new feature; it will allow us to discuss the best way to do it. It is obviously unnecessary if you just want to fix a typo or small errors in the code.

Please note that your code must follow the coding style defined by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org>`_ and pass tests. `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_ and `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest>`_ are used on this project to enforce the coding style.


Use a local database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reading data from the cloud API can be slow while developing. That's why it is possible to dump data to a file and to reuse it.

First dump the data (Subsonic API credential required)::

    flozz-daily-mix dumpdata -c file-with-credentials.conf music.db

Then you can use the data with the ``generate`` command::

    flozz-daily-mix generate --source-db=music.db --dry-run --print-playlist flozz-daily-mix.conf

**NOTE:** the command above does not require the API credential as it is both a dry-run (no write to the API) and we provide the data (no read from the API).


Run the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must install `Nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`__ first::

    pip3 install nox

Then you can check for lint error::

    nox --session lint

and run the tests::

    nox --session test

You can use following commands to run the tests only on a certain Python version (the corresponding Python interpreter must be installed on your machine)::

    nox --session test-3.8
    nox --session test-3.9
    nox --session test-3.10
    nox --session test-3.11
    nox --session test-3.12

You can also fix coding style errors automatically with::

    nox -s black_fix
